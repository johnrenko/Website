role: Product Designer
roleDescription: "As Product Designer, I redesigned the complete digital therapeutic experience: architecture, interface, and interactions. I defined three experience pillars — learning, tracking, and support — and built a clear, reassuring, and accessible design system for all patient profiles. I also worked with internal teams to ensure compliance with ANSM and DTx regulations."
impact: A prescribable device distributed in pharmacies
impactDescription: Quitoxil became one of the first French digital therapeutics approved by ANSM. The new design improved patient engagement and continuity of cessation. The app is now available in pharmacies as a boxed kit containing a QR code for one year of treatment.
