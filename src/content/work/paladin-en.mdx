company: Paladin
companyDescription: Paladin is a new generation French occupational health service (SPST) built around a proprietary SaaS product, compliant with legal frameworks (DMST, HAS, PGSSI-S) and designed from day one to improve coordination between physicians, employers, and employees.
role: Founding Designer
roleDescription: As Founding Designer, I defined the product vision, framed the user experience, and designed all interfaces — clinician, employer, and employee sides. I worked closely with the lead physician, founders, and engineering to turn complex regulatory constraints into a smooth, intuitive, and compliant tool. I also contributed to the official approval dossier validated by health authorities.
impact: Launching a certified, digital‑first player in occupational health
impactDescription: Paladin received official approval to start operations on January 1, 2026. Several companies are already ready to migrate their occupational health follow-up to this new model. The product delivers a unified, modern, and automated experience for all stakeholders, reducing admin load and improving quality of medical follow‑up.
