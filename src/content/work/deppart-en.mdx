company: Dep.Part.
companyDescription: "Dep.Part. is an iOS app that simplifies expense sharing between friends, family, or colleagues. It lets you track, split, and settle amounts among multiple people with a smooth interface and smart calculation algorithms."
role: Founder
roleDescription: "As the founder, I imagined, designed, and developed Dep.Part. solo â€” from the initial idea to the App Store release. I owned the full cycle: product design, SwiftUI development, database, notifications, and publish, to validate my technical skills and ability to turn a concept into a working product."
impact: "An app designed, built, and published independently"
impactDescription: "This project deepened my understanding of native iOS development and the App Store release process, while testing the alignment between my design principles and their technical implementation. The experience strengthened my empathy for developers and sharpened my ability to design truly implementable interfaces. A pedagogical project that paves the way for future personal app launches."
